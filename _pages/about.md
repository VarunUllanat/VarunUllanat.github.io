Welcome!

I am a AI/ML Engineer at the Department of [Informatics & Analytics @ Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://informatics-analytics.dfci.harvard.edu), where I work on developing and deploying models to improve clinical research. Previously, I was a research assistant at MIT with [Bonnie Berger](https://people.csail.mit.edu/bab/) and at Harvard with [Marinka Zitnik](https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu). 

I graduated with a B.Tech in Biotechnology from [RVCE](https://www.rvce.edu.in), India and a Masters in Biomedical Informatics from [Harvard Medical School](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu). 

I've spent 2 years as a volunteer at [Make A Difference](https://makeadiff.in), a non-profit organization in India dedicated to providing equitable outcomes for underprivileged children through education, mentorship, and support. 

In my free time I enjoy traveling, hiking, playing and watching soccer.
